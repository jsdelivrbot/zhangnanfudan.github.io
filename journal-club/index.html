				Title: On some nonconvex optimization problems with applications </br>
				Speaker: Dr. Rujun Jiang </br>
				Abstract: This talk addresses two problems on nonconvex optimization. We first derive a convex quadratic reformulation for the generalized trust region subproblem (GTRS), which minimizes a general quadratic function over a general quadratic constraint. We further show that this convex quadratic reformulation is equivalent to a minimization of the maximum of two convex quadratic functions. Although the latter minimization problem is a high dimensional nonsmooth problem, it is convex with good structure and we developed two efficient algorithms, based on different line search rules, to solve this reformulation for large scale and sparse GTRSs. We next investigate a portfolio optimization methodology using nonparametric Value-at-Risk (VaR). As the resulting models are nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, albeit with some special structures, we propose some specially devised block coordinate descent methods for finding approximate or local optimal solutions. Our simulation test and empirical analysis indicate that the mean-VaR models using nonparametric VaR are more robust compared to those using historical VaR or parametric VaR under the normal distribution assumption, especially when the information of the return distribution is limited.
